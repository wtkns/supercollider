you need ctk, and i think i used [fredrick olofsson's](https://github.com/redFrik) help on stuff in some of these so maybe reduniverse? its been a long time.

i dunno what works.

several of these used the same basic classes with the same name but different versions and i dont think they are compatible. for now, i think you can install extensions from each folder to play the files in that folder.

i plan to convert them each into their own Quark with unique class names... then go back and figure out how to generalize them
