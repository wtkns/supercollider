development of novel methods of understanding conceptual approaches to time
interaction of individual efforts
nonhierarchical, self-regulating systems, consisting of multiple actors
generating time for states to emerge
simultaneous shared source, context, concrete idea
how an individual responds to an event differently; subjectivity
anti-humanism
