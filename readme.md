this is my supercollider and AV research stuff for my personal use. I have gathered some of it from various other sources. i think its usually mostly vaguely attributed somewhere in the file. i assume its all public-ish, but some of it came from far back in the mists of time. If something of yours is in here and you want it removed or more clearly attributed, please let me know.

link .config/SuperCollider as ~/.config/SuperCollider

link .jackdrc in ~
